Developers in Java are familiar with Object oriented programming. The 'hero' there is an 'object'. Everything happens through an object.
You can 'call' the method on an object, or change the state of an object. You can pass an object to a method or return an object from a method.

In Functional programming, the 'hero' is the function. You don't pass a value but a function around. The function may take in a value and return an argument.
In a sense, you are passing a behaviour around instead of state.

From a java perspective we don't have to know more about functional programming, because here Lambda expressions are the drivers of functional programming.



It is a feature which is related to Lambda Expression. It allows us to reference constructors or methods without executing them.
Method references and Lambda are similar in that they both require a TARGET TYPE that consist of a COMPATIBLE FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE.

You can replace Lambda Expressions with Method References WHERE LAMDBA IS INVOKING ALREADY DEFINED METHODS.
You canâ€™t pass arguments to methods Reference.

Don't forget Functional interfaces are heart of labmda expression.
